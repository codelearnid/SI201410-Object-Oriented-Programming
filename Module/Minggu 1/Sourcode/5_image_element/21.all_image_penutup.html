<p>Located on the northwest coast of Java, 
Jakarta is the country's economic, cultural and political centre, 
and with a population of 9,761,407 as of December 2012, 
it is the most populous city in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia. 
The official metropolitan area, known as Jabodetabek 
(a name formed by combining the initial syllables of Jakarta, Bogor, 
Depok, Tangerang and Bekasi), is the second largest in the world, 
yet the metropolis's suburbs still continue beyond it.</p>

<p>Established in the fourth century, the city became an important 
trading port for the Kingdom of Sunda. It was the de facto capital 
of the Dutch East Indies (known as Batavia at that time). 
Today, the city has continued as the capital of Indonesia since 
the country's independence was declared in 1945. 
The city is currently the seat of the ASEAN Secretariat.</p>
